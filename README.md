# ServiceStack Routed Cache Client

## What

The ServiceStack Routed Cache Client is an `ICacheClient` implementation 
(`ICacheClientExtended` to be more exact) that acts as a facade 
to a collection of multiple other cache clients. 
It does not store cache values itself, but only routes 
various cache operations (read, write, flush, remove etc.) to a specific registered client, based on an associated rule 
(for instance, whether the key starts with a given string).  

## Why 

The main issue for me was (and possibly many others) that I could not register 
a different cache client for session storage (say, `OrmLiteCacheClient`), 
whilst continuing to make use of the standard `MemoryCacheClient `.
